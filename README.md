# Travel Explorer
## Overview

Travel Explorer is a student project developed by a group of 16 people. Our application helps tourists connect with other tourists and, by exchanging experiences, find tours and routes in the cities they visit that suit them best. One of the main problems that tourists face on their travels is finding the right tour, guide and sights in the city they are visiting. Our application offers a solution to that problem, providing them with the best solutions, depending on their previous travels, interests, etc.

Tourists can buy tours published by their authors. Within the tours, they can also fulfill some of the challenges that exist on those tours. On the other hand, our application offers the authors of tours the possibility of creating them, publishing them as well as constantly monitoring statistics on tour purchases.

## Technologies
- Back-end: C# with .NET (ASP .NET)
- Front-end: Angular + REST services
- Database: Relational (PostgreSQL)

## Development process

The development of the Travel Explorer application was executed by a team of 16 students, organized into 4 groups of 4 members each. We utilized Scrum, an agile methodology, to guide our development process.

### Team structure and workflow

- **Teams**: The 16-member team was divided into four smaller teams of 4 people each. Each team was responsible for different components of the application.
- **Sprints**: We followed a sprint-based approach, with each sprint lasting 4 weeks. At the end of every sprint, we conducted a review and retrospective to assess progress and identify areas for improvement.

### Stakeholder interaction

- **Interviews**: Throughout the development process, we conducted several interviews with stakeholders. These sessions allowed us to showcase specific features of the application and gather valuable feedback on functionality and user experience.
- **Backlog grooming**: Based on stakeholder feedback, we performed backlog grooming. This involved adding new tasks or functionalities to our Trello board or modifying existing ones to better align with user needs and expectations.

### Final presentation

- **Demo**: At the end of the development cycle, we organized a demo presentation for a wider audience that included professors, assistants, and fellow students. During this presentation, we demonstrated the application's features and its operational mechanics. We received constructive feedback from the audience, which provided us with insights into how we could further enhance the system and the final product.

## Testing

A significant part of the development of our project was testing. We implemented unit and integration testing in our development. The beginning of the development marked the Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) approach, which gave significantly worse results than the later applied TDD. Over time, we moved to Test-Driven Development, where we first wrote tests for each functionality, and then actually implemented it in the project.

## Getting started

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository
- Set up the backend using .NET (ASP.NET) and C#
- Set up the frontend using Angular
- Configure the database using pgAdmin
